Landing Zone

This is my project landing page. It is a work-in-progress, but I aim to bring everything to a centralized web-based work environment with this.

The platform will house a slew of modular applications such as: Bugger, Queued, Jot, Lucent

How do the modules work?

All application are contained inside of their ./php/* folder and each has their own php folder containing a script called, for example, bugger.php.
(//landing/php/Bugger/php/bugger.php)
