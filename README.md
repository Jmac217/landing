Landing Zone

This is my project landing page. It is a work-in-progress, and serves two purposes: I aim to bring everything to a centralized web-based work environment with this and generate simple TODO notes for applications.

I'm changing the names of things to feel less modular--Yes maybe it will be renamed and split up at a later point, but for now I think it makes sense to name it in order of use.
"Start Project" > "Project Queue" > "Jot a Note" > "Bug Tracker" > "Server Status"
