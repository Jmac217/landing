I want to slim down the #panel; maybe to half the width, but allow it to expand by clicking a button.
- moving modules to fit in to the lengthened list

To make things less static, it would be a good idea to generate listings with JSON -- Webapps, Modules, Scripts, and Databases and even Links Panel.
- the idea is to let the parser be generic enough to handle each individually and separately
! to start in this process I've moved each list to its own temporary html file within the json folder. This will help in determining the final result of each json file.

Create the global note tracker based on Bugger
- Rewrite for JSON and expand the fields to be more generic, and less modular.

Add specialized fields to note queue?
-	Project Name / Contract / Business - Name, email, phone / Due date / TODO / Quick Notes
* Create a login for this, otherwise it's really stupid to leave it online for too long.

Pull the inventory logger into global scope.
- For modules add log.json with urls to specific logs to include, this allows for expansion as long as the logger is generic enough to handle everything.
- Output is to plain text with my personal styling, so maybe write a schema for others to edit?
-	Results are shown in either HTML or plain-text
