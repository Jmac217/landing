Pre-Modularization

I'm going to break everything down into single file for during the core work, then separate them back into modules when the core is sufficient.


=======================================


* set up a notes category for body

 - Bugger is the only thing using this right now - 1:22|10-7-13
 
 ~ TODO

 - displays FTP information
 
 - Create a TODO listing slider

 
 
* Create the global bug tracker that has been needing to exist for a while.

== Bugger ==

 ~ TODO

 - right now inventory is set up, and bugger has space for extra databases, but not hooked up right now.
 
 
 
* Start up a project queue
 
== Project Queue ==

Project Name / Contract / Business - Name, email, phone / Due date / TODO / Quick Notes



* Create a login for this, otherwise it's really stupid to leave it online for too long.

== Login ==

username / password (*only me*)


== Logger ==

pull the inventory logger into global scope
