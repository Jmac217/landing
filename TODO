Pre-Modularization

I'm going to break everything down into single file for during the core work, then separate them back into modules when the core is sufficient.


=======================================


Global Design Specs

I want to slim down the #panel; maybe to half the width, but allow it to expand by clicking a button.
- moving modules to fit in to the lengthened list


	* set up a notes category for body

	 - Bugger is the only thing using this right now - 1:22|10-7-13
	 
	 ~ TODO

	 - displays FTP information
	 
	 - Create a TODO listing slider

	 
	 
	* Create the global bug tracker that has been needing to exist for a while.

== Bugger ==

	 ~ TODO

	 - right now inventory is set up, and bugger has space for extra databases, but not hooked up right now.
	 
	 
	 
	* Start up a project queue
 
== Queued ==

	This is my project queue

	it will display each project in order of priority and also link to the todo page if necessary.

	This will allow me to keep tabs on all current projects and select, and change, priority.
	

	Project Name / Contract / Business - Name, email, phone / Due date / TODO / Quick Notes

	* Create a login for this, otherwise it's really stupid to leave it online for too long.

== Login ==

	username / password (*only me*)


== Logger ==

	pull the inventory logger into global scope

== Jot ==

	This is a simple TODO note taking application.

	Output is to plain text with my-type styling.

	Results are HTML


	Outline:

	get todos per category - site specific todo list

	add todo entries where necessary
