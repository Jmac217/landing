Add and View have different hierarchies to them; add must display all available properties to be given to the entry, but display them as needed and use auto-incrementation for select duplicate fields set by the admin. View on the other hand is meant to show the basic information and present the extra information when it's necessary ie model field has more than one model, but the value of printer_amount is hidden until focused.
