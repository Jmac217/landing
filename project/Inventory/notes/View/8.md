Add logic for when an 'amount' is changed for update to check the database for others of the same amount and change them too; this might be inefficient, but hell I guess I could always figure out another way- besides the separated SQL databases: maybe with JSON values to be added and updated similarly to the SQL instance. That would also give me a reason to finally start working on alternative databases.
