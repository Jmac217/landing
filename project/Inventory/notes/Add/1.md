Add.php switches could be loaded in as XML in a page-per-page setup under something like "/XML/pages". I really like this idea: it would entail a slight rework of the way pages are handled, but it would make things very helpful later for importing and exporting. I'm adding a mockup to /XML/pages.xml.txt
